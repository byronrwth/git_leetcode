Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the second highest salary is 200. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

SELECT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name,column_name ASC|DESC;

用 多种嵌套 实现 Nth select 大小排序:

e.g. 第三大

(
SELECT MAX(Salary) from Employee 
WHERE Salary <  
      (  
         SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
         WHERE Salary < 
             ( 
               SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
             )  # 1st 第一大
      )# 2nd 第二大
);  # 3rd 第三大
